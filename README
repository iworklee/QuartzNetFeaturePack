OVERVIEW
This project contains additional features that are not available in the main Quartz.Net distribution. The goal of this project is to gather commonly used items built by the community to enhance Quartz.Net. Generic job types, triggers and calendars are probably the main components that this project will contain, but time will tell. I am starting this project because the main Quartz.Net distribution mirrors pretty closely the java version of Quartz and thus anything that is not contained in the java version might be better off in a separate project.
